# Natural_Language_Processing
Unit 12: Sentiment Analysis, NLP, Named Entity Recognition

## Background

In this assignment, I applied natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. By applying fundamental NPL techniques, I was distill recent articles into common words and phrases, organizations, and entities mentioned in these articles to better understand how recent news can affect coin price.

## Process

### 1 - Sentiment Analysis

I used the newsapi to pull the latest news articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum in order to create dataframes with sentiment scores for each coin.

### 2 - Natural Language Processing

I used NLTK and Python to tokenize text, find n-gram counts, and create word clouds for each digital asset.


### 3 - Named Entity Recognition

In this section, I built a named entity recognition model for both coins and visualize the tags using SpaCy.
